/**
 * Plannotator Inbox: New message (PLAN step 8; owner Q4, "just another button
 * next to reply", built as a try).
 *
 * The live sessions: every agent connection long-polls the bridge for its
 * session (packages/server/inbox.ts, `bridgePoll`), and a poll says where the
 * session works (`project_path`), when it started and whether a turn runs; a
 * `state` event says when that changes. A session is live while it polled
 * within `INBOX_SESSION_LIVE_MS`, or holds a poll open now. Kept in memory
 * only: after an Inbox restart a session is live again at its next poll.
 *
 * A session is in a thread's project when its `project_path` resolves to the
 * project's root (the resolution send_message uses: realpath, then the
 * repository, a linked worktree counting as its main repository), or, for
 * a connection that does not say where it works, when it wrote in that
 * project.
 *
 * The window's two routes (same origin and the page's serverSession, as every
 * window route):
 *   GET  /api/inbox/threads/:id/sessions  the project's live sessions, the
 *        thread's own writers first;
 *   POST /api/inbox/threads/:id/message   `{ session, body, idempotency_key }`:
 *        the person's message, addressed to that session while it is live
 *        (409 `session_not_live` otherwise, nothing written). Its connection
 *        is handed it on its next poll and delivers it like a reply.
 *
 * Replying when the asking session has ended (design record "replying when
 * the asking agent's session has ended", not in this repo): the sessions
 * route also answers whether the session that asked (`?asker=<session>`) is
 * still there (`asker: { session, live }`), with a grace of
 * `INBOX_ASKER_GRACE_MS` so a short gap, or an Inbox that just started and
 * has not heard from its sessions yet, never reads as ended. The reply route
 * (packages/server/inbox.ts) takes `to: { host, session }` and checks it with
 * `replyTarget`, as New message does.
